## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to convey professionalism and modernity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) for interactive elements like the submit button, providing a clear call to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear and modern readability across all text elements.
- Employ a single-column layout to guide the user's eye directly down the form.
- Use a subtle fade-in animation on the confirmation page to create a smooth transition after form submission.
